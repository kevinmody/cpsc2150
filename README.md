Sami's Software Development

All the java class and main files are in src folder. Some of them also include and need makefile to run the program. 

The main project was to make a connect 4 game using interface and testing to pass all the cases. So project 1 and 2 was basically adding user stories and UML Diagrams, and a game with 2 players. Project 3 is adding multiple users which includes creating a toString and interface file. Project 4 was testing all our code and passing them. In Project 5, we actually implemented GUI. 


Note: On my honor I have neither given nor received aid on this exam nor the projects.
